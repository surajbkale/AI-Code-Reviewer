```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`function sum(a, b)`**: This declares a function named `sum` that takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. These parameters will hold the numbers you want to add together.
* **`return a + b;`**: This line performs the addition of the two parameters `a` and `b` and then `return`s the result.  The `return` statement is essential; it's what makes the function actually *give back* the computed sum.

**How to use it:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // Call the function with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result); // Output: 8

let x = 10;
let y = 2;
let anotherResult = sum(x, y);
console.log(anotherResult); // Output: 12
```

**Key Improvements & Considerations:**

* **Parameters:**  The original `function sum() { return a+b }` was missing parameter definitions.  Without parameters, it would rely on variables `a` and `b` being defined in the *global* scope, which is generally bad practice. Defining parameters `a` and `b` within the function's parentheses makes it clear that the function *expects* these values to be provided when it's called.
* **`return` Statement:** The `return` statement is absolutely crucial.  Without it, the function would perform the addition but not provide any value back to the code that called it.  The result of the addition would be lost.
* **Clarity:**  The code is now much clearer and easier to understand because it explicitly defines what the function does and how it's meant to be used.
* **Scope:**  The variables `a` and `b` are now *local* to the `sum` function.  This means they only exist within the function's execution and won't interfere with any other variables in your code.  This is important for avoiding unexpected side effects and making your code more modular.

This revised version is a complete and functional JavaScript function that correctly adds two numbers.  It's also written with best practices in mind.
